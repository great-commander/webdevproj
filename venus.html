        <p>It's a cloud-swaddled planet named for a love goddess, often called Earth’s twin. But pull up a bit closer,
            and Venus turns hellish. Our nearest planetary neighbor, the second planet from the Sun, has a surface hot
            enough to melt lead. The atmosphere is so thick that, from the surface, the Sun is just a smear of light.
            <br><br>
            Namesake
            The ancient Romans could easily see seven bright objects in the sky: the Sun, the Moon, and the five
            brightest planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn). They named the objects after their most
            important gods. Venus, the third brightest object after the Sun and Moon, was named after the Roman goddess
            of love and beauty. It’s the only planet named after a female god.

            Potential for Life
            Thirty miles up (about 50 kilometers), temperatures range from 86 to 158 Fahrenheit (30 to 70 Celsius), a
            range that, even at its higher-end, could accommodate Earthly life, such as “extremophile” microbes. And
            atmospheric pressure at that height is similar to what we find on Earth’s surface.
            <br><br>
            Size and Distance
            Our nearness to Venus is a matter of perspective. The planet is nearly as big around as Earth – 7,521 miles
            (12,104 kilometers) across, versus 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) for Earth. From Earth, Venus is the
            brightest object in the night sky after our own Moon. The ancients, therefore, gave it great importance in
            their cultures, even thinking it was two objects: a morning star and an evening star. That’s where the trick
            of perspective comes in.
            <br><br>
            Orbit and Rotation
            Spending a day on Venus would be quite a disorienting experience – that is, if your ship or suit could
            protect you from temperatures in the range of 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 Celsius). For one thing, your
            “day” would be 243 Earth days long – longer even than a Venus year (one trip around the Sun), which takes
            only 225 Earth days. For another, because of the planet's extremely slow rotation, sunrise to sunset would
            take 117 Earth days. And by the way, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east, because Venus spins
            backward compared to Earth.
            <br><br>
            From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units
            away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.
            From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.
