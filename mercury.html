        <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than
            Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it
            does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.
            <br><br>
            Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the
            Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at
            night, temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).
            <br><br>
            Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title
            belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping
            around the Sun every 88 Earth days.
            <br><br>
            Namesake
            Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.
            <br><br>
            Potential for Life
            Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar radiation that
            characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.
            <br><br>
            Size and Distance
            With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth.
            If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.
            <br><br>
            From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units
            away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.
            From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.
