        <p>Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter cold. The fourth planet from the Sun,
            Mars is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other). Mars is one of the easiest
            planets to spot in the night sky – it looks like a bright red point of light.
            <br><br>
            Namesake
            Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of
            blood. Other civilizations also named the planet for this attribute – for example, the Egyptians called it
            "Her Desher," meaning "the red one." Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron
            minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.
            <br><br>
            Potential for Life
            Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're looking for signs
            of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.
            <br><br>
            Size and Distance
            With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the
            size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.

            From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away
            from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this
            distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.

            From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical
            unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to
            Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.

            It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.
            <br><br>
            Orbit and Rotation
            As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on
            Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols – short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols,
            which is the same as 687 Earth days.

            From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units
            away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From
            this distance, it takes Sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.
            <br><br>
            Moons
            Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids. They're potato-shaped because
            they have too little mass for gravity to make them spherical.
            <br><br>
            Formation
            When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity
            pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half the size of
            Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.
