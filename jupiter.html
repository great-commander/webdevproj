        <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than
            twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy
            clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red
            Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.
            <br><br>
            Jupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons. Jupiter also has several rings, but unlike the famous rings of
            Saturn, Jupiter’s rings are very faint and made of dust, not ice.
            <br><br>
            Namesake
            Jupiter, being the biggest planet, gets its name from the king of the ancient Roman gods.
            <br><br>
            Potential for Life
            Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and
            materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.
            <br><br>
            Size and Distance
            With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the
            size of a nickel, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.

            From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units
            away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From
            this distance, it takes Sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.
            <br><br>
            Orbit and Rotation
            Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes only about 10 hours (the time it
            takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year
            in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).
            <br><br>
            Moons
            With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter has 53
            confirmed moons and 26 provisional moons awaiting confirmation of discovery. Moons are named after they are
            confirmed.
