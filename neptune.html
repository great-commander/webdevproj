        <p>Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our
            solar system. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar
            system not visible to the naked eye. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery
            in 1846.
            <br><br>
            Namesake
            The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical calculations. Using predictions made
            by Urbain Le Verrier, Johann Galle discovered the planet in 1846. The planet is named after the Roman god of
            the sea, as suggested by Le Verrier.
            <br><br>
            Potential for Life
            Neptune's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials
            that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.
            <br><br>
            Size and Distance
            With a radius of 15,299.4 miles (24,622 kilometers), Neptune is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth
            were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball.

            From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 astronomical units
            away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From
            this distance, it takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune.
            <br><br>
            Orbit and Rotation
            One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours (the time it takes for Neptune to rotate or spin once). And Neptune
            makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Neptunian time) in about 165 Earth years (60,190 Earth
            days).
            <br><br>
            Moons
            Neptune has 14 known moons. Neptune's largest moon Triton was discovered on October 10, 1846, by William
            Lassell, just 17 days after Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet. Since Neptune was named for the
            Roman god of the sea, its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.

            Neptune has at least five main rings and four prominent ring arcs that we know of so far. Starting near the
            planet and moving outward, the main rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago, and Adams. The rings
            are thought to be relatively young and short-lived.
