        <p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by
            living things. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our
            solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest
            of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
            <br><br>
            Namesake
            The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and
            Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”
            <br><br>
            Potential for Life
            Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. Most
            notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the temperature allows
            liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life
            to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.
            <br><br>
            Size and Distance
            With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets and the
            fifth largest planet overall.

            From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical
            unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to
            Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.

            It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.
            <br><br>
            Orbit and Rotation
            As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete one
            trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts
            one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four
            years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a leap year.

            From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units
            away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From
            this distance, it takes Sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.
            <br><br>
            Moons
            Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object in the
            night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It stabilizes our
            planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.
            <br><br>
            Formation
            When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed when gravity
            pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial
            planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.
