        <p>The seventh planet from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and
            windy. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree
            angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side, orbiting the
            Sun like a rolling ball.
            <br><br>
            Namesake
            William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead,
            the planet was named for Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode.
            <br><br>
            Potential for Life
            Uranus' environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that
            characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.
            <br><br>
            Size and Distance
            With a radius of 15,759.2 miles (25,362 kilometers), Uranus is 4 times wider than Earth. If Earth was the
            size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.

            From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is 19.8 astronomical units
            away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From
            this distance, it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus.
            <br><br>
            Orbit and Rotation
            One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours (the time it takes for Uranus to rotate or spin once). And Uranus
            makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Uranian time) in about 84 Earth years (30,687 Earth days).
            <br><br>
            Moons
            Uranus has 27 known moons. While most of the satellites orbiting other planets take their names from Greek
            or Roman mythology, Uranus' moons are unique in being named for characters from the works of William
            Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.
            <br><br>
            Rings
            Uranus has two sets of rings. The inner system of nine rings consists mostly of narrow, dark grey rings.
            There are two outer rings: the innermost one is reddish like dusty rings elsewhere in the solar system, and
            the outer ring is blue like Saturn's E ring.
